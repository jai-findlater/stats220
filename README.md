# STATS 220 - Jai
## Overview
This is my repository for **STATS 220** and it's also the first repository I've ever made on **GitHub**.

This is also the first time I have ever used R let alone the {magick} package. Below is a list of some of the coding languages I have used before:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)

I have most knowledge in **Python, HTML and CSS**.

## Reason For The Repo

- *Link to the **GitHub** Repository - [stats220](https://github.com/jai-findlater/stats220)*

- *Link to the **GitHub* Pages - [Index](https://jai-findlater.github.io/stats220/)*

- *This is where I will be storing lots of my files for **STATS 220** throughout this course!*

- *Throughout this semester we will be doing 5 projects*

## Project 1
For project 1 we have been tasked to make a meme using R, but also using the [Magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) package.

- For this Project, my stats220 GitHub repo stores my README.md, .nojekyll and index.html files.

### Some things that our HTML document will provide are:

1. The **inspiration** meme
2. The **meme** we created
3. The **animated meme** we created
4. The **code** for our created memes
5. **Reflections** and **Justifications**, etc.
