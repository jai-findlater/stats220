## STATS 220
This is my repository for **STATS 220** and it's also the first repository I've ever made on **GitHub**.

- *Link to the **GitHub** Repository - [stats220](https://github.com/jai-findlater/stats220)*

- *This is where I will be storing lots of my files for **STATS 220** throughout this course!*

- *Throughout this semester we will be doing 5 projects*

## Project 1
For project 1 we have been tasked to make a meme using R, but also using the [Magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) package.
